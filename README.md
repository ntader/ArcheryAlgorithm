## Introduction
Using projectile motion, an angle of launch can be determined and applied in an Olympic archery setting. Paired with an Arduino microcontroller, the derivations can be used to create a device that will assist an archer in training their muscle memory. The purpose of this document is to explain derivations as well as electronic components, should future modifications need to be adjusted/implemented.
